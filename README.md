# RADIFOX Conversion Tools
The RADIFOX conversion tools are a set of command line scripts and Python modules for converting DICOM (and PARREC) files to NIfTI files using the RADIFOX naming system.
These tools are a wrapper around the `dcm2niix` tool that use the RADIFOX naming system to organize the output files.
The conversion tools also include automatic logging and QA image generation.
JSON sidecar files are created for each NIfTI file that contain critical metadata and conversion information.

## Installation
`radifox-convert` is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:
```bash
pip install radifox-convert
```

## Basic Usage
### CLI Scripts
The `radifox-convert` package includes a number of CLI scripts to convert data and update conversions.
These scripts are installed to your PATH when you install the `radifox-convert` package.
For a full listing of command line options, see [Advanced CLI Usage](#advanced-cli-usage).

#### `radifox-convert`
The `radifox-convert` script is used to convert DICOM files to NIfTI files using the `dcm2niix` tool.
It is a wrapper around `dcm2niix` that uses the RADIFOX naming system to organize the output files.

**Single subject conversion:**
```bash
radifox-convert \
    --output-root /path/to/output \
    --project-id study \
    --subject-id 123456 \
    --session-id 1 \
    /path/to/dicom_files
```
This will copy the files in the direction `/path/to/dicom_files` to the output directory `/path/to/output/study/123456/STUDY-1/dcm`, organize them and convert them to NIfTI.
The NIfTI files (and their JSON sidecar files) will be placed in `/path/to/output/study/STUDY-123456/1/nii`.

**Batch conversion** (`--batch`):
```bash
radifox-convert /path/to/dicom_parent_dir \
    --output-root /path/to/output \
    --project-id study \
    --batch
```
In batch mode, `source` is treated as a parent directory containing subject subdirectories.
The `PatientID` from DICOM headers is used as the subject ID and each subdirectory is converted automatically.
The `--subject-id` and `--session-id` options are not used in batch mode.

**Batch conversion with anonymization** (`--anon-db`):
```bash
radifox-convert /path/to/dicom_parent_dir \
    --output-root /path/to/output \
    --project-id study \
    --anon-db /path/to/mapping.db \
    --date-shift-days 42
```
When `--anon-db` is provided, batch mode and anonymization are automatically enabled. Random anonymous IDs replace patient identifiers, identifiers are hashed, UIDs are randomized, copied DICOM files are removed, and a full reversible mapping is stored in the SQLite database.
The mapping database stores the original `PatientID`, `PatientName`, `PatientBirthDate`, `PatientSex`, source paths, original Study UIDs, Institution Names, and date shift days.
If the same `PatientID` appears in multiple subdirectories, they are assigned the same anonymous ID with auto-incremented session numbers.

Output directories will use the anonymous ID instead of the patient identifier:
```
/path/to/output/study/STUDY-A3F7B2C1D4E5/1/nii/...
```

The mapping database at `/path/to/mapping.db` contains the link between anonymous IDs and original patient identifiers.
This file should be stored securely and separately from the converted output.

#### `radifox-update`
The `radifox-update` script is used to update naming for a directory of images.
This is commonly done after an update to RADIFOX to ensure that all images are named according to the latest version of the naming system.
It also could be done to incorporate a new look-up table or manual naming entries after QA.

Example Usage:
```bash
radifox-update --directory /path/to/output/study/STUDY-123456/1
```
This will update the naming for all images in the existing RADIFOX session directory `/path/to/output/study/STUDY-123456/1`.
If the RADIFOX version, look-up table, or manual naming entries have changed, the images will be renamed to reflect the new information.
If none of these have changed, the update will be skipped.

**De-anonymization** (`--deanonymize`):

The `--deanonymize` flag reverses anonymization using the mapping database created by `--anon-db`.
It renames directories, files, and patches JSON sidecar metadata to restore original patient identifiers.

What is restored:
- Subject directories and filenames are renamed from anonymous IDs back to original `PatientID`
- `SubjectID` in JSON sidecar metadata
- `SourcePath` in JSON sidecar series entries
- Original `InstitutionName` (un-hashed)
- Original `StudyUID` (un-randomized)
- Acquisition dates (date shift reversed, if applicable)

What cannot be restored:
- Raw DICOM/PARREC files (permanently deleted during anonymized conversion)

```bash
# De-anonymize all subjects
radifox-convert \
    --output-root /path/to/output \
    --project-id study \
    --anon-db /path/to/mapping.db \
    --deanonymize

# De-anonymize a single patient
radifox-convert \
    --output-root /path/to/output \
    --project-id study \
    --anon-db /path/to/mapping.db \
    --deanonymize \
    --subject 123456
```

# Conversion
The conversion system is a wrapper around the `dcm2niix` tool.
It uses the RADIFOX naming system to organize the output files.
`radifox-convert` is the core command for this function.

The conversion process is as follows:
 1. Copy the DICOM files to the `dcm` directory in the session directory.
 2. Sort the DICOM files into series directories in the `dcm` directory and remove any duplicates.
 3. Check for series that should be skipped (scouts, localizers, derived images, etc.). Use `--force-derived` to include derived/secondary series.
 4. Generate image names automatically from the DICOM metadata, look-up tables, and manual naming entries.
 5. Convert the DICOM files to NIfTI using `dcm2niix` and rename to RADIFOX naming.
 6. Create the JSON sidecar files for the NIfTI files (contains some DICOM metadata).
 7. Create QA images for the converted NIfTI files.

## Look-up Tables
The look-up tables are a set of rules for automatically naming images based on the DICOM `SeriesDescription` tag.
They are stored in a comma-separated values (CSV) file in each project folder.
They have a specific name format: `<project-id>_lut.csv`.
If no look-up table is found for a project, a blank look-up table is written.
Look-up table values take precidence over automatic naming, but are overwritten by manual names.

The look-up table file has five total columns: `Project`, `Site`, `InstitutionName`, `SeriesDescription`, and `OutputFilename`.

The first three columns (`Project`, `Site`, and `InstitutionName`) narrow down which images are affected.
These columns match the project and site IDs and the DICOM `InstitutionName` tag.
This means that if a particular site or even scanning center uses a specific `SeriesDescription`, it can be handled differently than others.
The `Site` and `InstitutionName` columns are optional and can be `None`.

The `SeriesDescription` column is a string and must **exactly** match the DICOM `SeriesDescription` tag.
This may mean that multiple rows are needed to cover all possible values of the `SeriesDescription` tag for a particular name.

The `OutputFilename` column is where the RADIFOX naming is specified.
You do not have to specify all components of the name, only the ones that need to be changed.
For example, if you only want to change the `bodypart` to `BRAIN` for a specific `SeriesDescription`, you can specify `BRAIN` in the `OutputFilename` column.
However, you must specify all components that come prior to the one you want to change as `None`.
For example, to change the `modality` to `T1` for a specific `SeriesDescription`, you must specify `None-T1` in the `OutputFilename` column.
This can also be used to change the `extras`, by specifying them at the end of the `OutputFilename` column.
For example, to add `ECHO1` to the end of the name for a specific `SeriesDescription`, but change nothing else, you must specify `None-None-None-None-None-None-ECHO1` in the `OutputFilename` column.

## Manual Naming
Manual naming entries are the most specific way to name images.
They are stored as a JSON file in each session directory (`<subject-id>_<session-id>_ManualNaming.json`).
This JSON file is a dictionary with the DICOM series directory path (`dcm/...`) as the key and the new name as the value.
This series path can be found as the `SourcePath` in the sidecar JSON file for the image.
Manual naming entries take precidence over look-up tables and automatic naming.
The naming convention for manual naming entries is the same as for look-up tables.

The simplest way to create manual naming entries is to use the `radifox-qa` webapp.

## JSON Sidecar Files
JSON sidecar files are created for each NIfTI file during conversion.
They contain information about the conversion process (versions, look-up table values, manual naming, etc.) as well as critical DICOM metadata.
The JSON sidecar files are stored in the `nii` directory in eact session directory next to their corresponding NIfTI file.

Sidecar files are human-readable, but can also be accessed in Python using the `json` standard package.
Most of the crutial information will be in the `SeriesInfo` key of the sidecar file.

```python
import json

obj = json.load(open('/path/to/output/study/STUDY-123456/1/nii/STUDY-123456_01-03_BRAIN-T1-IRFSPGR-3D-SAGITTAL-PRE.json'))
print(obj['SeriesInfo']['SeriesDescription']) # prints 'IRFSPGR 3D SAGITTAL PRE'
print(obj('SeriesInfo')['SliceThickness']) # prints 1.0
```

A complete record of the sidecar JSON format is below [JSON Sidecar Format](#json-sidecar-format).

## Automatic Logging
The auto-provenance system also includes automatic logging during execution.
This is done by setting up a `logging` handler that writes to the `logs` directory in the session directory.
This handler is set up by default to log all messages to the `logs/<module-name>/<first-input-filename>-<timestamp>-info.log` file.
This can be adjusted to `logs/<module-name>-<timestamp>-info.log` by setting `log_uses_filename` to `False` in the `ProcessingModule` subclass.
Currently, there is support for `INFO`, `WARNING` and `ERROR` level messages.
They can be accessed at any point in the `run` method by calling `logging.info(message)` (or `warning` or `error`).
You must import `logging` at the top of the file to use this feature.
If there are warnings or errors produced during execution, they will be written to additional log files (`-warning.log` and `-error.log`) for easy viewing.
There is currently no support for `DEBUG` level messages, but that is planned for the future.

## Automatic QA Images
The auto-provenance system also includes automatic generation of QA images from outputs.
Any output that is returned from the `run` method will have a QA image generated automatically, if it is a NIfTI file (ends in `.nii.gz`).

## JSON Sidecar Format
The JSON sidecar format is a dictionary with 8 top-level keys:
 - `__version__`: A dictionary of software versions used in conversion (`radifox` and `dcm2niix`)
 - `InputHash`: A hash of the input directory or archive file used in conversion
 - `LookupTable`: A dictionary of look-up table values used in conversion (limited by project/site ID/institution, if applicable)
 - `ManualNames`: A dictionary of manual name entries used in conversion
 - `Metadata`: A dictionary of session level metadata items (Project ID, Subject ID, Session ID, etc.)
